## Abstract
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), with a poor 5-year survival rate, has risen as a leading cause of cancer-related deaths. The molecular landscape of PDAC remains unveiled. This study profiled the expression of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and their regulatory networks underpinning PDAC progression. Using high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on 441,758 cells, we characterized cell-type-specific and conserved expression patterns of lncRNAs in PDAC. Notably, we constructed an updated cell atlas of the PDAC microenvironment. We further clarified the dynamic expression of lncRNAs in heterogeneous ductal cells, unraveling their pivotal roles in diverse biological pathways. This research offers insights into the regulatory mechanisms of lncRNAs responsible for intratumor heterogeneity in PDAC. Our findings may guide future explorations for therapeutic strategies against PDAC.
